# Onboarding Documentation for the132Debuggers (Team 9)

## Introduction 
### Project Overview
Our project is a **Harry Potter** themed **fortune-telling** application. It can provide user the exact experience whether they are a fan or simply seek answers that might align with their personality. 

There are four Hogwarts Houses in our app: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff. User can select their house or be randomly assigned to a house, and the answer to their fortune-telling question will be based on the corresponding theme of each house. 
- For example, if the user is a Gryffindor (a house known for having people who are brave and noble) the app may predict that they go on some sort of adventure, become a marine--tasks that require bravery or being noble.

The apps list of answers are targeted towards yes and no questions. 


### Stakeholders 
Professor Powell and our TA Gagan are the key stakeholders involved in this project. They have a vested interest in our project's success and can provide guidance, evaluation, feedback, and support throughout the development process. 

## Technical Stack
### Technologies and Programming Languages
We are using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for implementing this project project. JavaScript is the primary programming language used for implementing this project. We also leverage the Shadow DOM feature in JavaScript to encapsulate and isolate the components of our application, providing improved modularity and preventing CSS and JavaScript conflicts. 

### Version Control
We are using (Github)[https://github.com/the132Debuggers/cse110-sp23-the132Debuggers] as our version control system. Detail of requirements could be found in [Branching, Merging, and Pull Request Process](#branching-merging-and-pull-request-process) section. 

### Openai API
We are using `openai` api to generate the answer for users' fortune-telling questions.
