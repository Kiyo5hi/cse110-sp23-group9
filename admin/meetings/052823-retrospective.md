# Team Retrospective after first code sprint!
## What went well:

### We had good consistent routine
* Had routine meetings scheduled every week to get work done
* Split up into teams ui/ux and development team to divide work
* Our ci pipeline for how we checked code for pushing to git was very helpful
* Team leads delegated very well so everyone knew what to do at all times

### Communication was one of our greatest strengths
* Team was very communicative on Slack
* Team was very active asynchronously (PRs were reviewed approved within 10 minutes) 
* Had consistent recurring meetings (either on saturday or sunday or sometimes even both)
* TA was very responsive in helping us

### Workload balance protected against solo burdens
* Didn’t have one person doing all the work
* Teamwork was there, those that couldn’t help as much with technical responsibilities compensated with putting more effort and taking more soft responsibilities → allowed developers to put more focus onto their technical * responsibilities.
* Meeting notes were always accessible and updated instantly so team member can read up on what they missed if they couldn’t attend a meeting

## What did not go well:
	
### Things out of our control (very understandable)
* Time was very limited and our schedules only lined up during the weekends
* Couldn’t meet in person a lot of the times so majority of meetings were on zoom
* Wanted to do too many features for our project in the beginning
* Sometimes had some last minute schedule changes

## What can be improved:

### Trying to get control of what was not in our control (what did not go well)
* Have more meetings throughout the week if possible
* Some programs we used were difficult to navigate through

## What surprised us: (What challenges or obstacles did we face?)

### Bad?
* Has to pay for code climate before use (so we actually don’t have a code quality tool)

### Good?
* Members stepped up in time of need

## Did we achieve our goals and set deadlines:
Given the magnitude of our task (trying to get an MVP) and our limited resources (approximately a week to complete by) we are very satisfied with our outcome. It was tough only being able to convene once per week and trusting each member to make progress on their assigned tasks before the next meeting. However, we were supportive of each other’s availability and did our very best to produce quality work. We were very flexible with one another and aimed to optimize everyone’s value and efforts; this way, week by week we can yield consistent progress and thus have a solid frame of reference on what we can and cannot accomplish. Because of our consistency, we had a very clear sense of our project scope and decided upon very reasonable expectations. Reflecting upon our efforts, we were very close to fulfilling all of our expectations. For most of our group members, this is their first code sprint and we will not be harsh on one another. We view the early hiccups as learning opportunities and feel much more confident for our next code sprint. We conclude that this code sprint was a huge success.
