# Decision to Use ESLint Instead of JSLint

## Context

During the development of our JavaScript project, we needed a tool to enforce coding standards, catch potential errors, and ensure consistent code quality. We recognized the importance of using a linter to improve the overall maintainability of the codebase.

## Decision

After evaluating available options, we decided to use ESLint as our linting tool instead of JSLint. ESLint provides a more flexible and configurable approach to linting, offering a wider range of rules and customization options. This decision was made to leverage the benefits of ESLint's extensive ecosystem, support for modern JavaScript features, and its ability to align with our project's specific needs.

## Rationale

The following factors influenced our decision to choose ESLint over JSLint:

1. **Flexibility and Configurability**: ESLint allows us to enable or disable specific rules, configure rule options, and create custom rules. This level of customization enables us to adapt the linting rules to our project's coding style and preferences.

2. **Rule Sets and Coverage**: ESLint provides a comprehensive set of rules that cover a broader range of coding conventions, including ECMAScript standards and community best practices. This ensures that our code adheres to the latest industry standards and helps prevent potential bugs or issues.

3. **Plugin Ecosystem**: ESLint has a thriving plugin ecosystem developed by the community. This allows us to extend ESLint's functionality and integrate with other tools, such as code editors or build systems. The availability of plugins ensures that we can easily enhance our linting process and address specific project requirements.

4. **Modern JavaScript Support**: ESLint is actively maintained and updated to support the latest ECMAScript features. This ensures that we can leverage the full power of modern JavaScript syntax while benefiting from ESLint's comprehensive rule set.

## Alternatives

We considered JSLint as an alternative to ESLint. However, JSLint's strict and opinionated approach, lack of customization options, and limited rule set did not align with our project's requirements. We needed a more flexible tool that could be tailored to our coding style and adapt to evolving industry standards.

## Implications

The decision to use ESLint has several implications:

- Developers will need to configure ESLint to match our project's coding standards and preferences.
- Team members will require some familiarity with ESLint's configuration and rules in order to effectively use the tool.
- ESLint will be integrated into our development workflow and build system to enforce linting rules and provide feedback during development.

None

## Status

Accepted

## Decision Outcome

ESLint has been integrated into our development process. We have created a shared ESLint configuration file that aligns with our project's coding style and requirements. Developers are encouraged to use ESLint during their development workflow to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
