# Decision to Reject Utility-First CSS

## Context

During the development of our project, we considered different approaches for managing and organizing our CSS styles. One of the options we evaluated was utility-first CSS, a methodology that focuses on composing styles through utility classes rather than writing traditional component-specific styles.

## Decision

After careful consideration and analysis, we decided to reject utility-first CSS and opt for a different approach to managing our CSS styles.

## Rationale

The following factors influenced our decision to reject utility-first CSS:

1. **Maintainability**: Utility-first CSS can lead to an excessive proliferation of utility classes throughout the codebase. This can make it challenging to track and manage styles, especially as the project grows larger and more complex. The heavy reliance on utility classes may result in a lack of clarity and maintainability in the long run.

2. **Readability**: Utility-first CSS heavily emphasizes abbreviated class names and shorthand notations. While this approach can save some typing, it may sacrifice code readability and understanding. The codebase becomes less intuitive, and developers may need to rely heavily on documentation or memorization of class names to understand the styles applied.

3. **Limited Customization**: Utility-first CSS promotes reusing existing utility classes instead of creating custom styles. This can limit the flexibility and customization options available for creating unique designs or implementing specific UI components. Developers may find it challenging to deviate from the predefined utility classes, potentially resulting in a lack of visual diversity or consistency across the application.

4. **Potential Overhead**: Utility-first CSS frameworks often come with a large set of predefined utility classes. Including the entire framework in the project, even if only a fraction of the utility classes are used, can result in unnecessary overhead in terms of file size and performance.

5. **Learning Curve**: Utility-first CSS introduces a different way of thinking about styling and requires developers to learn and understand the specific utility class conventions and syntax. This learning curve may impact productivity and hinder the onboarding process for new team members.

## Alternatives

We explored other CSS methodologies and approaches, such as component-based CSS (using CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, or CSS preprocessors) or adopting a design system. These alternatives offer more flexibility, scalability, and maintainability compared to utility-first CSS.

## Implications

The decision to reject utility-first CSS has the following implications:

- Developers will follow a different approach for managing CSS styles, such as component-based CSS or utilizing a design system.
- Team members will need to familiarize themselves with the chosen CSS methodology or design system and its associated conventions.

None

## Status

Accepted

## Decision Outcome

Utility-first CSS has been rejected as the chosen approach for managing CSS styles in our project. Instead, we will adopt an alternative approach, such as component-based CSS or utilizing a design system. The team will ensure that styles are organized, maintainable, and allow for customization while considering factors like scalability, performance, and ease of understanding for developers.
